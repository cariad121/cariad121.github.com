       <h1>Providing freelance and private support to schools and families, helping children to engage in education.</h1>
</p>
<p>Acorn Holistic Children and Young People Service offers high quality pupil and family support to Schools by reducing barriers to learning and assisting schools to focus on teaching and learning.
By offering a bespoke service dependant on need, we believe our service offers real value for money, and can represent a direct and high impact use of Pupil Premium funding.
</p>
<blockquote>At Acorn Holistic, we passionately believe that everyone should have the opportunity to reach their potential.</blockquote>
<p>It can be very difficult to support children, young people and their families to actively engage in education and to help children develop a positive commitment to learning. Research has shown that to improve pupil outcomes, focus must be placed on language, literacy, numeracy, but it is also important to focus on the parental support of a child’s learning and the child’s personal and social skills. 
In these difficult times of austerity and efficiency savings, Schools and families are finding that many of the services that were designed to help them are either being decommissioned, criteria and thresholds made more demanding or some services now present a significant cost to the school budget. In practical terms, Schools are now having to deal with many non-academic issues with very little help and support. Through necessity, Schools are being encouraged to become more pro-active and innovative in how they work with the behavioural, emotional and social difficulties presented by their pupils, and their families.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Addressing emerging issues before they become entrenched problems</h2>
<p>
<p>The objective of Acorn Holistic is to provide a one stop shop resource for non-academic requirements of students and their families. Offering a bespoke service dependent on need, Acorn Holistic joins up and integrates different services and approaches such as family outreach, targeted support and education welfare – to provide an effective early intervention service specific to your school or child.</p>
